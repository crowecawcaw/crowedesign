      <p>The Rice Chi Alpha site exists both to promote the group to new and incoming students and to provide easy access to various resources for current students. The site uses a clean, straight forward design that features large images to convey a sense of the group. It also delivers a podcast feed of the weekly messages.</p>
      <p>When redesigning the site, a large focus was put on search engine optimization (SEO). Through keyword research, performance optimizations, and strategic formatting, the site moved up from the third page of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rice+christian+group" target="_blank">Google search results</a> to within the first three driving new traffic to the site and increasing interest in the group.</p>

      <p>After years with the same site design, Revival House Chruch decided to refresh their website for a more modern look. The homepage background features a video montage of the church to give potential visiters a sense of what the church is like and what to expect. The new design is built on Wordpress to allow the church to easily update their own website as new events come up.</p>
