    <div class="portfolio-description">
      <p>The Rice Chi Alpha site exists both to promote the group to new and incoming students and to provide easy access to various resources for current students. The site uses a clean, straight forward design that features large images to convey a sense of the group. It also delivers a podcast feed of the weekly messages.</p>
      <p>When redesigning the site, a large focus was put on search engine optimization (SEO). Through keyword research, performance optimizations, and strategic formatting, the site moved up from the third page of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rice+christian+group" target="_blank">Google search results</a> to within the first three driving new traffic to the site and increasing interest in the group.</p>

    <div class="portfolio-description">
      <p>Breath of Life decided to revamp their website both for a new desing and to better engage visiters and current members. The homepage especially was structured to provide all the most commonly sought information upfront - service time and location and upcoming events. The site features an easy-to-use event system so members can easily find the upcoming events and so the church staff can update their events page themselves. The site was completed in under two weeks.</p>

The homepage background features a video montage of the church to give potential visiters a sense of what the church is like and what to expect.
