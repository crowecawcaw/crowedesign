      <p>The Rice Chi Alpha site exists both to promote the group to new and incoming students and to provide easy access to various resources for current students. The site uses a clean, straight forward design that features large images to convey a sense of the group. It also serves a weekly podcast</p>
      <p>When redesigning the site, a large focus was put on search engine optimization (SEO). Through keyword research, performance optimizations, and strategic formatting, the site moved up from the third page of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rice+christian+group" target="_blank">Google search results</a> to within the first three driving new traffic to the site and increasing interest in the group.</p>
